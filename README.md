# tensorflow-notebooks

[nbviewer for the repo](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MSeeker1340/tensorflow-notebooks/tree/master/)

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks on TensorFlow (both Python and Julia API). I plan to add more as I continue to learn and experiment with TensorFlow.

## [TensorFlow.jl Guide](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MSeeker1340/tensorflow-notebooks/tree/master/TensorFlow.jl%20Guide/)

WIP.

These are translated versions of the official [TensorFlow guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/) to the Julia API. Since TensorFlow.jl doesn't support high level APIs like `tf.keras` and `tf.estimator` yet the focus is on the low level graph API, e.g. `Tensor`, `Operation` and `Session`s.

The [TensorFlow.jl documentation](http://malmaud.github.io/TensorFlow.jl/latest/) is very lacking at the moment so it's my hope that first users of TensorFlow.jl can have a better time learning the library.
